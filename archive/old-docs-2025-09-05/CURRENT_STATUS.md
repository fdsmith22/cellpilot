# CellM8 Current Status

## What We Fixed
1. ✅ Added null checks to prevent "Argument cannot be null: newText" error
2. ✅ Enhanced chart creation to use different columns for each vizIndex
3. ✅ Added comprehensive logging to track chart creation
4. ✅ Fixed Library.js export issues

## Current Testing Method (Manual but Reliable)
1. Open your test Google Sheet
2. Go to Extensions > CellPilot > Open CellPilot
3. Navigate to CellM8 Presentation Creator
4. Configure settings and click Create
5. Check the created presentation

## Enhanced Logging Available
The following console.log statements will appear in the Execution transcript:
- `CHART CLEANUP: Found X charts to remove`
- `CREATING CHART: vizIndex=X, type=Y`
- `CHART DATA SELECTION: Starting for vizIndex=X`
- `SELECTED COLUMNS: indices=[...]`
- `SELECTED HEADERS: Column names`
- `RANGE NOTATION: A1:B100 for chart X`
- `CHART CREATED: ID=xyz123`

## Known Issues
- Charts might still be duplicating (need to verify through manual testing)
- Testing through Apps Script editor has limitations

## Files Modified
- `src/CellM8.js` - Main presentation logic with fixes
- `src/Library.js` - Fixed exports for library usage
- `src/CellM8Test.js` - Test functions (for future use)
- `src/CellM8StandaloneTest.js` - Standalone tests (for future use)

## Next Steps
1. Test manually through CellPilot sidebar
2. Check if charts are now unique in the presentation
3. If still duplicating, we have detailed logs to debug

## To Deploy (If Needed)
```bash
clasp deploy --description "CellM8 chart uniqueness fixes"
```

## Reverting Changes (If Needed)
The git history has all previous versions if we need to revert.
